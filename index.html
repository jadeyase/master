                                <p>“This book takes you through some of the experiences of the harsh conditions and hazards traversing the Oregon Trail route during the western emigration, while drawing you into young Dan’s coming-of-age story. The storyteller uses a light touch on the story and on the authentic-detail, as you travel along with Dan when he is on his own, fending with only an old flintlock musket and his ‘possibles’ bag of sparse supplies.”</p>

                            <p>It was the first time he’d been to a funeral that he could remember. The bodies had been laid out in the cabin before bein’ put into their rude boxes. It made him sick to see the ropes lower the bodies into the ground and to hear the clods hittin’ the tops of the coffins. He hated the dream. Nothin’ was as final as death.</p>
